# Justification
You're likely familiar with using Finder, Windows Explorer, etc. You can do a lot of powerful things like creating, deleting, moving, opening & editing files.

Unix allows you to do all of the same things as Finder (and more!), but using special keywords called **commands**. Instead of clicking on buttons, you type in commands into the **command line**.

Why learn this whole other language for something we can do with a few clicks? Automation. Don't want to create a file a thousand times in a row. We can write **scripts** that do this for us. 

# Some terminology
A **directory** is another word for a folder. A **file** is everything that is not a directory: images, text files, code.

# The command line
When the shell is first opened, you are presented with a prompt, indicating that the shell is waiting for input. This is something the computer provides to you. You don't type it.

Let's write our first shell command. Type `ls` into the command line. This stands for **list structures** which will list everything in our current directory.

It's okay to make a mistake. Let's see what happens when we type something that isn't a command. Type `ks`.

We get an error message. Get comfortable reading error messages, because we'll be making a lot of typos today. Error messages are important because they give info about how to fix what you typed.
