## Listing unique species
Leah has several hundred data files, each of which is formatted like this:

```
2013-11-05,deer,5
2013-11-05,rabbit,22
2013-11-05,raccoon,7
2013-11-06,rabbit,19
2013-11-06,deer,2
2013-11-06,fox,1
2013-11-07,rabbit,18
2013-11-07,bear,1
```

An example of this type of file is given in `data-shell/data/animal-counts/animals.txt`.

We can use the command `cut -d , -f 2 animals.txt | sort | uniq` to produce the unique species in `animals.txt`. In order to avoid having to type out this series of commands every time, a scientist may choose to write a shell script instead.

Write a shell script called `species.sh` that takes any number of filenames as command-line arguments, and uses a variation of the above command to print a list of the unique species appearing in each of those files separately.

```
# Script to find unique species in csv files where species is the second data field
# This script accepts any number of file names as command line arguments

# Loop over all files
for file in $@
do
	echo "Unique species in $file:"
	# Extract species names
	cut -d , -f 2 $file | sort | uniq
done
```

## Working with our history
The command `history` gives a list of past commands you have typed. 

If you run the command:

```
history | tail -n 5 > recent.sh
```

the last command in the file is the history command itself, i.e., the shell has added history to the command log before actually running it. In fact, the shell always adds commands to the log before running them. Why do you think it does this?

If a command causes something to crash or hang, it might be useful to know what that command was, in order to investigate the problem. Were the command only be recorded after running it, we would not have a record of the last command run in the event of a crash.

In practice, most people develop shell scripts by running commands at the shell prompt a few times to make sure theyâ€™re doing the right thing, then saving them in a file for re-use. This style of work allows people to recycle what they discover about their data and their workflow with one call to `history` and a bit of editing to clean up the output and save it as a shell script.

## Variables in Shell Scripts 
In the `molecule`s directory, imagine you have a shell script called `script.sh` containing the following commands:

```
head -n $2 $1
tail -n $3 $1
```

While you are in the `molecules` directory, you type the following command:

`bash script.sh '*.pdb' 1 1`

Which of the following outputs would you expect to see?

1. All of the lines between the first and the last lines of each file ending in .pdb in the molecules directory
1. The first and the last line of each file ending in .pdb in the molecules directory
1. The first and the last line of each file in the molecules directory
1. An error because of the quotes around *.pdb

The correct answer is 2.

The special variables $1, $2 and $3 represent the command line arguments given to the script, such that the commands run are:

```
$ head -n 1 cubane.pdb ethane.pdb octane.pdb pentane.pdb propane.pdb
$ tail -n 1 cubane.pdb ethane.pdb octane.pdb pentane.pdb propane.pdb
```

The shell does not expand `'*.pdb'` because it is enclosed by quote marks. As such, the first argument to the script is `'*.pdb'` which gets expanded within the script by head and tail.

## Write your own shell script!
Write a shell script called longest.sh that takes the name of a directory and a filename extension as its arguments, and prints out the name of the file with the most lines in that directory with that extension. For example:

`bash longest.sh /tmp/data pdb`

would print the name of the `.pdb` file in `/tmp/data` that has the most lines.

```
# Shell script which takes two arguments:
#    1. a directory name
#    2. a file extension
# and prints the name of the file in that directory
# with the most lines which matches the file extension.

wc -l $1/*.$2 | sort -n | tail -n 2 | head -n 1
```
