# 10-14 to 10-14 workshop: Unix Shell

## Feedback from sticky notes
- Opinions on pace: just right for newbies, too slow for people with a little experience
- Explanation on loops could use improvement (some were confused about the notion that variable names in loops could change)

## Things to do next time
- Re: activities
  - Enforcing some kind of soft time limit on activities. Not everyone will put their stickies up when noticed
  - Go over answers for activities afterward, even if answers are provided 
  - Add a few activity items (there are a few topics, notably `rm`, that aren't covered)
- Re: specific lessons/topics
  - Really explain that variables can change. Update notes to show this, and include an activity where the variable names change but the base code is the same
  - I think the loops lesson could have the activities combined (so there's one set of activities)
- How to keep interesting for people with experience, but not let others fall behind?
  - More activities? Challenge questions?
- Should we introduce shell scripts earlier?
  - Didn't get to that lesson, and I don't think it would be wise to cut for loops in favor of shell scripts. 
  - Is there any room for condensing some of the earlier lessons?
